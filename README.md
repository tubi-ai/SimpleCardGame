This Java code implements a Simple Card Game using the Swing library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The game is a straightforward card-matching game where the player selects a card suit and a rank, and then the game randomly selects a card. Points are awarded based on the match between the player's selected card and the randomly drawn card.

Key Components:
GUI Components:

JFrame: The main window of the application.
JLabel: Used to display the images of the cards.
JComboBox: Allows the player to select a card rank (e.g., Ace, 2, 3,..., King).
JRadioButton: Allows the player to select a card suit (Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades).
JButton: Used to initiate the card match by clicking "CHECK".
JTextArea: Displays the current score.
Card Representation:

Icons Array: The icons array stores the images of the cards and the card back.
getCard() Method: Generates the card image file paths based on the card's rank and suit.
Game Logic:

Random Card Selection: A random card is selected from the deck when the player clicks "CHECK".
Scoring:
10 points if both rank and suit match.
5 points if only the rank matches.
3 points if only the suit matches.
-1 point for no match.
Win/Loss Conditions: The player wins if the score reaches 25 or loses if the score drops to 0.
Interactivity:

The game listens for user actions like selecting a card suit or rank, and pressing the "CHECK" button. Based on these inputs, the game updates the card display and the player's score.
Summary:
This game is a simple, interactive card-matching game that challenges the player to guess a randomly selected card. The game features a basic GUI with user inputs and dynamic updates, making it an accessible and easy-to-understand application for demonstrating basic Java GUI and game logic concepts.
